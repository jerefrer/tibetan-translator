'du byed|This absolutely should never be translated as “formation” or “fabrication”. Rather, it is something like “former” or “fabricator” or “producer”.\nReasons:\n1) Per the Khajjaniya sutta: “And why, monks, do you call them ‘saṅkhāras’? Because they produce produced things, monks, that is why they are called ‘saṅkhāras’.”\n2) They are called {'du byed} in Tibetan. {byed} is an agentive ending in Tibetan grammar, analogous to the English suffix “-er” or “-or”, and is contrasted with the patientive ending {byas}. Cf. saṃskṛta {'dus byas} “produced thing”.\n3) Miphams Khejuk says “{rnam shes la yang srid kyi sa bon 'debs pas 'du byed ces bya ste/}” i.e. “Because they plant the seed of rebirth in one’s consciousness, they are called ‘producers.’ “\n4) The illustrative example for saṃskāras in the {bka' gdams pha chos/} is a potter. The text says “{'du byed dag ni rdza mkhan bzhin/}” i.e. “Producers are like a potter.” Potters are producers, not products.\nTherefore, this does not mean “formation”.

gtub|to cut (this appears to originally be the transitive form of {thub})

gtan|stable, unwavering (looks like a transitive root)\ncf. {'than}
'than|stable, unwavering (looks like an intransitive root)\ncf. {gtan}
gtal|to hit (this appears to originally be the transitive root of {thal})

lung|1) valley\n2) quote, citation (cf. {lung 'dren}) — the idea of a “reading transmission” is basically just that you are receiving the “quote” of a text.\nNote: This word seems to have originally meant something like “source”, which would naturally lead to its meaning of “quote” and its meaning of “place where someone is from” in the common phrase {khyed rang lung pa ga nas yin/}. This is also supported morphologically through l-/phy- alternation in {lung}/{phyung}. Similar alternation is seen in the pairs {phyogs}/{logs} (side), {phyag}/{lag} (hand), and {phye}/{le} (division).
